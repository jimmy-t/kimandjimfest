							    Less than a month to go! Kim's got a pretty, white dress, Jim's got snazzy, bespoke suit, and we're about darn ready to do this thing! We cannot wait to see all of your beautiful faces in Nashville, and to say our "I Do's" and celebrate all weekend long!!! We have a few more important details right now, and look for one more update before the big day.
							   	<br/><br/>
							    We are using the <b>Wedding Mix</b> app in place of a traditional videographer.  This means that our guests get to document the wedding for us!   <a class="jk-content-link" href="./index.html?tab=mix">Click here for Wedding Mix details</a>.  Please take some time to check it out ahead of time, and download the app -- once you have the app, you can start recording and uploading, including your travels and preparation.
							    <br/><br/>
							    <b><u>AFTER-PARTY UPDATE</u>:</b> The after-party is now at Jonathan's Grille (instead of at the hotel), which is a sports bar very close to the hotel.  <a class="jk-content-link" href="./index.html?tab=after-party">Click here for After-Party details</a>.

				    		  	Nashville is perfect for us because we love music and nature, and Nashville has plenty of both.  We're really excited to celebrate our marriage with all of our guests, but we're also looking forward to sharing a few days in an awesome city with our most favorite people.  We encourage you to take some time to visit Nashville and create some special memories over the course of the weekend... and we can't wait to party with every single one of you!

						    	Friday night we're having our rehearsal dinner at Noble's Kitchen & Beer Hall in East Nashville.  After 8:00 PM, we're inviting all the wedding guests in town to come and join us for a drink or two.  The bar is a 10-minute ride from all the bars and honky tonks in downtown Nashville.  We recommend either starting your night off or finishing it up with us here in East Nashville.
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	There are lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance of Noble's if you wanted to just stay in the neighborhood.  Since we're only having the biggest day of our lives on Saturday, we'll probably duck out a bit early ourselves, but if you're inclined to stay out later go for it -- the ceremony isn't until Saturday evening, so hopefully you'll have time to recover ;)
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	<b>Note: Noble's is 21+ after 10:00 PM.</b>
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	It should be easy to find parking in East Nashville, but if you're thinking about heading downtown you might be better off just taking an Uber.  If you're super brave, there are also bus stops nearby, but we're not familiar with them.

						    	We're happy to have another chance to see y'all on Sunday morning, and to enjoy some coffee and donuts together before everyone starts heading home or off to see the sights. We've booked the pavillion at Nashville's iconic <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.nashville.gov/Parks-and-Recreation/Parks/Centennial-Park.aspx" target="_blank">Centennial Park</a>, and we'll be there from <b>11 AM</b> till about <b>3 PM</b>.  If you're fancy and want a double-soy-mocha-latte-frappuccino and <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://biscuitlove.com/menu" target="_blank">gourmet egg and biscuit sandwich</a>, feel free to pick one up and join us anyways.  It's a 25-minute drive from the hotel, but there's plenty of free parking.
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	<b>
						    	NOTE: This event is happening on a Sunday in the bible-belt, and drinking in public is prohibited. We ask that you try to abstain if you join us at the park unless you don't mind paying yuge fines ;)
						    	</b>
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	Centennial Park is in the West End neighborhood and is one of the most famous public parks in Nashville due to its <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.nashville.gov/Parks-and-Recreation/Parthenon.aspx" target="_blank">full-size Parthenon tribute</a>! The park also has a playground, a paved bike/walking path around a pond, and lots of green space to sprawl out or play games on. After some coffee, donuts, and good company, we'll probably be in much need of a nap, but we encourage those sticking around town to explore the park, have a picnic, or check out some of the other fun things Nashville offers.  You can even tour the Parthenon itself for six bucks!
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	We don't know much about the West End neighborhood, but it's adjacent to Vanderbilt and Hillsboro, which are great neighborhoods for shopping and eating.  You can also quickly get to Music Row, home to a lot of the music labels and recording studios.

								We will provide a shuttle from the Mariott to/from the wedding, and the hotel provides a shuttle to/from the Nashville airport.  The hotel has free parking for anyone who's bringing or renting a car.

						    	<br/></br>

								Mt. Juliet is a suburb of Nashville and the hotel is right by <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://goo.gl/maps/MctBECoLvkx" target="_blank">Providence Marketplace</a> which has a movie theater and tons of shops and restaurants, so anyone who stays here would be able to find whatever they need to have a fun and comfortable weekend.  While it's not downtown, it should be easy to make it down there to see the sights or enjoy the nightlife.

						    	Jim and I will stay at the Mariott on the night of our wedding, but we've also booked a home in East Nashville for the rest of our trip.  It's near a well known stretch of bars and restaurants called <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://goo.gl/maps/DyKEaYPUuZ42" target="_blank">the Five Points</a>.  We'll be sharing the house with our bridal party, and we all hope to visit with everyone outside of the wedding day. We plan to get to Nashville on Wednesday 5/23, and will most likely stay in town till Tuesday 5/29. We are totally planning to take advantage of all the fun Nashville has to offer, and look forward to seeing you all around town!

						    	Obviously the coolest thing happening this weekend in Nashville will be our wedding 😄, but for those of you who are extending your stay we have some suggestions for other things to check out. Here's a <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://nashville.micromaps.com/m/index.php?map_id=1959" target="_blank">handy Nashville neighborhood map</a> for those of you who want to explore the city.  Also, here's <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://youtu.be/kKEIZbh0uXUa" target="_blank">a quick video/slideshow</a> that mentions a lot of the sites we recommend.
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	Nashville is also home to <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/brewery+in+nashville,+tn/@36.1550371,-86.7931067,12.63z" target="_blank">a TON of breweries and brew-pubs</a>, though we unfortunately haven't had a chance to visit many of them yet ourselves.  If you're into visiting breweries, you shouldn't have much trouble finding either a brewery or a brew-pub serving plenty of locally brewed beers, wherever you are.
						    </p>

						    	<b><u>The Blue Bird </u></b>
						    	<br/>
						    	<a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.bluebirdcafe.com/" target="_blank">The Blue Bird Cafe</a> is probably our top recommendation for those who have time.  It's an iconic venue, and widely loved by music fans world-wide. It's famous for being the place where many singer-songwriters started their careers (watch <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://youtu.be/3CgBNGHM54Q" target="_blank">this video</a> to learn more). It's <b>SMALL</b>, and it can be <b>very</b> tricky to get advance reservations/tickets. <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.bluebirdcafe.com/reservations" target="_blank">Follow this link to figure out the ticket process</a>, and if you're interested, we encourage you to follow their instructions.
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	If you don't get tickets ahead of time, you can try your luck by waiting in line. When we went, we waited about 2 hours in the sun for the 6;30 show, and it was worth it. Tickets are cheap, and the food is good, and it is so cool to see these musicians in such a intimate setting. It doesn't matter if the musicians aren't famous (yet), you'll love hearing their stories about why they wrote the songs they play, and what it's like to be a part of the Nashville music scene.
						    </p>
						    <p class="jk-tab-contents">
						    	<b><u>Music Row / Midtown</u></b>
						    	<br/>
						    	Music Row is a neighborhood well-known for being home to a lot of the music labels and recording studios.  We love <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://therownashville.com/" target="_blank">The Row Kitchen & Pub</a> there - they have great food, and live music everyday. The artists play requests for tips, and it's fun to hear different takes on well known songs.
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	There is a wide variety of bars within walking distance or super-short ubers, anything from rowdy party bars (<a class="jk-content-link" href="http://winnersbarnashville.com/" target="_blank">Winner's</a>) to a local brewery (<a class="jk-content-link" href="https://www.tailgatebeer.com/" target="_blank">Tailgate</a>) to a bar-cade (<a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.twobitsnashville.com/" target="_blank">Two-Bits</a>).
							</p>
						    <p class="jk-tab-contents">
						    	<b><u>East Nashville</u></b>
						    	<br/>
								This is the neighborhood where we're staying - we're still learning about it, but it seems really cool so far. You can also find us in East Nashville at our Friday night pre-party at <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://noblesbeerhall.com/" target="_blank">Noble's Kitchen & Beer Hall</a>!  We've enjoyed some great cocktails and food at <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.margotcafe.com/" target="_blank">Margot Cafe</a> 🐈 and some truly decadent donuts from <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.fivedaughtersbakery.com/" target="_blank">Five Daughters</a> (also featuring GF and Paleo donuts). <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.fivepointspizza.com/" target="_blank">Five Points Pizza</a> and <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.grazenashville.com/" target="_blank">Graze</a> (vegetarian food) both come highly recommended.
						    	<br/><br/>
								If you're interested in shopping in East Nashville, <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://fatherlanddistrict.com/shoppes-on-fatherland/" target="_blank">Fatherland</a> is a cute outdoor mall nearby with lots of fun stores to browse. And the <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://goo.gl/maps/88zHeipZ1f72" target="_blank">Five Points</a> intersection hosts a several bars and restaurants making it really easy for a bar crawl.  <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://www.nashville.gov/Parks-and-Recreation/Nature-Centers-and-Natural-Areas/Shelby-Bottoms-Nature-Center.aspx" target="_blank">Shelby Bottoms Nature Center</a> is a large park in East Nashville if you're looking to hang outdoors.  There's also a golf course nearby.
							</p>
						    <p class="jk-tab-contents">
						    	<b><u>Hillsboro Village</u></b>
						    	<br/>
						    	We highly recommend visiting this neighborhood if you enjoy great brunch, and some shopping. It features two of Nashville's most popular brunch spots, <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://biscuitlove.com/" target="_blank">Biscuit Love</a> and <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://www.thepancakepantry.com/" target="_blank">Pancake Pantry</a>, and has <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://nashvilleguru.com/neighborhoods/hillsboro-village/shop" target="_blank">lots of cute and unique stores</a>.  Kim really likes <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.pangaeanashville.com/" target="_blank">Pangaea</a> and <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://athousandfaces.com/" target="_blank">A Thousand Faces</a>.
							</p>
						    <p class="jk-tab-contents">
						    	<b><u>Downtown Daytime</u></b>
						    	<br/>
						    	The <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://nashvillefarmersmarket.org/" target="_blank">Nashville Farmer's Market</a> is open 362 days a year. They have a convenient food court with lots of tasty and cheap options, and some cute stores inside and outside to explore. It's also very close to <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://tnstateparks.com/parks/about/bicentennial-mall" target="_blank">Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park</a>, which is another great park to explore and features the Tennessee Capitol building.
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	<a class="jk-content-link" href="https://www.marathonvillage.net/#thescoop" target="_blank">Marathon Village</a> is a mall in the restored Marathon Motor Works building. It features <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://gswinery.com/" target="_blank">a winery</a> (with WINE SLUSHIES), <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.corsairdistillery.com/home" target="_blank">a distillery</a>, and a tattoo parlor, so the fun there is just waiting for you. It also has <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://www.marathonvillage.net/shop/" target="_blank">a lot of cute stores</a>, including one that is part of <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.antiquearchaeology.com/locations.php" target="_blank">the American Pickers franchise</a>, so you know, if you're into that.
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	<a class="jk-content-link" href="https://goo.gl/maps/NZG5e1Xfyx82" target="_blank">The Gulch</a> is supposed to be a really trendy neighborhood, but we haven't spent much time here.  The most popular <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://biscuitlove.com/" target="_blank">Biscuit Love</a> location is here, plus other shopping and restaurants.
							</p>
						    <p class="jk-tab-contents">
						    	<b><u>Joyride</u></b>
						    	<br/>
						    	You'll see <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://joyrideus.com/nashville/" target="_blank">these guys</a> driving around Downtown and Music Row. They pick people up in a golf cart and take them for a fun little ride to all the hot spots in the city. They work for tips, and I think they get a cut if they can convince you to try a particular bar.  You can flag them down or call to set up a ride - its a pretty fun way to get around.
						    </p>
						    <p class="jk-tab-contents">
						    	<b><u>Downtown Nighttime</u></b>
						    	<br/>
						    	You literally can't miss the bars and Honky-Tonks on Lower Broadway, because they are lit up like Vegas and super loud. It's fun, and crazy, to bar crawl there. We recommend you do it, but feel no shame if you decide its not for you. On Friday and Saturday nights it's super packed, so be prepared or go earlier in the day. Our favorite Honky-Tonk is <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://robertswesternworld.com/" target="_blank">Robert's Western World</a>. <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.stillerynashville.com/" target="_blank">The Stillery</a> is a nice dinner spot, and if you are there late night and start to get hungry, we recommend <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://sundinernashville.com/" target="_blank">Sun Diner</a> and their donut, sausage, and egg sandwich (YOLO, right?).
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	The other spot worth checking out is <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://goo.gl/maps/hwzTVci2CN32" target="_blank">Printer's Alley</a>. It's a little off the beaten path and away from the tourist circus on Broadway. We prefer blues music far more than country, so <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://www.bourbonstreetbluesandboogiebar.com/" target="_blank">Bourbon Street Boogie and Blues Bar</a> is always a welcome change of pace. Next door, <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://skullsrainbowroom.com/" target="_blank">Skull's Rainbow Room</a> offers some great cocktails and some fun entertainment with a burlesque show and a lively band. We also really enjoyed <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://thefarmhousetn.com/" target="_blank">The Farm House</a> for great craft cocktails and delicious locally sourced meal.
							</p>
						    <p class="jk-tab-contents">
						    	<b><u>Outside Nashville</u></b>
						    	<br/>
						    	Fun Fact, we considered the mansion at <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://fontanel.com/" target="_blank">Fontanel</a> as a wedding venue. This is a mansion formerly owned by Barbara Mandrell, and is now owned by her recorded label. The record label offers tours of the home and rents it out for events.  It's fun to walk through and see all the hit records, signed guitars, and hallways of mirrors. On the Fontanel property, they also have <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.natchezhills.com/Visit-Us/Our-Tasting-Room " target="_blank">a winery</a>, <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://prichardsdistillery.com/fontanel/" target="_blank">a distillery</a>, <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://fontanel.com/attractions/zipline-forest/" target="_blank">a zipline course</a>, walking trails, picnic tables, and souvenir shopping.
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	<a class="jk-content-link" href="https://cheekwood.org/" target="_blank">Cheekwood Estate & Gardens</a> was another potential wedding venue, and you can have a wonderful time there outdoors touring the gorgous property and gardens.
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	Opryland is out east, where you can wander the massive indoor gardens at <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bnago-gaylord-opryland-resort-and-convention-center/" target="_blank">The Opryland Resort</a>, or check out the <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://www.opry.com/" target="_blank">Grand Ole Opry House</a>.
						    	<br/><br/>
						    	There are quite a few parks near Nashville, though we haven't been to many of them in person.  <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://www.nashville.gov/Parks-and-Recreation/Parks/Two-Rivers-Park.aspx" target="_blank">Two Rivers Park</a> has a water park, skate park, frisbee golf course, actual golf course, bicycle rentals, and plenty of paths for hiking or bike-riding.  If you're looking for a picnic or a hike, maybe check out <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://tnstateparks.com/parks/about/radnor-lake" target="_blank">Radnor Lake</a>, <a class="jk-content-link" href="https://www.nashville.gov/Parks-and-Recreation/Nature-Centers-and-Natural-Areas/Warner-Park-Nature-Center.aspx" target="_blank">Warner Park Nature Center</a>, or <a class="jk-content-link" href="http://tnstateparks.com/parks/about/long-hunter" target="_blank">Long Hunter State Park</a> (note: we haven't been to any of these last three).
